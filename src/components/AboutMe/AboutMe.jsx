          I am a software developer with a focus on building responsive and scalable web applications. I believe a website should be more than a series of pagesâ€”it should authentically reflect the brand or individual it represents. With a solid grounding in computer science principles and programming languages, I approach every project with a commitment to excellence. Whether working collaboratively or independently, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality results through perseverance and meticulous attention to detail.</p>
